                        the trustworthiness of our services. A refund policy is a protocol that allows you to ask for a

                        level of client satisfaction and maintain a healthy relationship with them. Assignment Helper Deutsch
                        aims to reach the epitome of customer convenience and is against of becoming a roadblock in student

                        Our team always strives to ensure the delivery of high-quality work alone, while our writers employ
                        the maximum level of their writing skills towards the requirements of their students. Our entire
                        platform functions by keeping ‘top scores’ as its primary objective. Still, in some cases,
                        unfortunate incidents are to be expected wherein the writer may not be able to meet your
                        expectations. This is majorly due to the involvement of human brains and skills in writing your
                        papers, apart from any artificial influences. In such unexpected scenarios, our well-formulated
                        refund policy can help you gain relief.

                    <h2 class="text-4xl pb-3">How Does Your Refund Policy Work?</h2>
                    <p class="my-4">
                        If you are new to our platform, you might face some confusion regarding the quality of our papers,
                        often leading to a hesitation to make full payments. We have encountered similar cases before and
                        directly witnessed their hesitation and confusion. Students are the most naive section of our
                        population, and this digital age has only mushroomed the number of scammers. As a professional
                        platform existing in such an ecosystem, we are responsible for proving our genuineness, especially
                        to newcomers. So, as an effective solution, we have set up a partial payment and full payment policy
                        for students. By choosing partial payment, you receive access to verify the quality of our services
                        before confirming the same. After partial payment, you will receive the initial 50% of the work,
                        based on which you can decide whether to go ahead with Assignment Helper Deutsch. If you find our work
                        satisfactory, you can clear the remaining payment. Otherwise, we will refund your payment after
                        deducting the GST rates applied. On the other hand, if you choose our full payment and are
                        disappointed in our work, we will refund your amount, after deducting GST. However, please note that
                        a refund is not possible after doing any edits or corrections to the work. To receive their refunds,
                        students must ensure that their dissatisfaction is duly conveyed before carrying out any sort of
                        edits after delivery.

                <div class="pt-5">
                    <h2 class="text-4xl pb-3">What Students Must Do?</h2>
                    <p class="my-4">
                        After receiving our work, kindly go through the same thoroughly. Crosscheck whether our writer has
                        included everything as per your request and is subject-oriented. This must be prioritized as we have
                        a strict policy regarding the edits or correction work. You must submit your editing suggestions
                        within 10 working days after delivery. Within this period, all the edits, irrespective of their
                        gravity, will be free of cost. But, if you submit your editing suggestions after this 10-day
                        timeline, additional costs might be charged based on the depth of the suggestions.
                    </p>
                    <p class="my-4">
                        If your editing requests major changes, resulting in an increase in word count or any other aspects
                        that might conflict with the initially delivered work, you might receive an additional price quote.
                        However, owing to our student-friendly nature, all these developments will be duly discussed and
                        verified with you before any move from our side. Our customer care consists of responsive,
                        understanding and empathetic executives, who have kept your happiness as their goal. So, please feel
                        free to have regular conversations with them about your concerns, confusion and our refund criteria.
                        They are always happy to guide you in the right direction!

                    <h4 class="my-4 font-semibold text-2xl">You Must Take a Note of This Before Ordering Our Services! </h4>
                    <p class="my-4">
                        Deadlines have a crucial role in deciding the total marks of your submission. Be it an assignment,
                        thesis, dissertation or any other academic paper, the only way to please your professor is to submit
                        outstanding content on the requested date alone. To make this possible, our entire team, including
                        our writers and customer care professionals, relentlessly strive to prepare such a masterpiece on
                        time. As a professional platform, we are bound to conduct our responsibilities without fail. Your
                        collaboration with our platform is a two-way process where both parties must work hand-in-hand to
                        stimulate high scores. Thereafter, students approaching us must ensure that they have fulfilled the
                        below-mentioned criteria:

                                For subject-driven work like research reports, thesis, dissertations, etc., intense work is
                                required that can demand substantial time and effort from our academic writers. In such
                                cases, please ensure to approach us and suggest a deadline at least 2 weeks prior to the
                                submission date. This will give a sufficient amount of time for both parties to work on
                                editing, proofreading and final touch-up works, enhancing the quality of your paper.

                                Kindly cross-check the difficulty level and subject cruciality of your paper. This will
                                prevent the suggestion of a hurried delivery date from your side, again increasing the
                                quality scale of your work.

                                If you choose the partial payment option, please note that a reasonable delivery date from
                                our side can be decided only after the delivery of this partial work. On the other hand, the
                                full payment option guarantees the delivery of your work at least 2 days before the exact
