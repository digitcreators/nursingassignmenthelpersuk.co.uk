                    Assignment Helper Deutsch promises our students an experience worth remembering. We are on a mission to
                    become their permanent partner for academic papers. Thereafter, every single feature of our platform can
                    be found strictly revolving around student convenience. We have recruited veteran writers to our
                    academic writing team to ensure that there is no downfall in terms of the quality of the paper
                    delivered. Keeping this in mind, our writers are continuously refining their skills to captivate high
                    scores through their writings. Still, there can be unpredictable situations wherein you can get
                    disappointed by our services. The reasons can vary, starting from inadequate information, deviation from
                    the requirements, incorrect sources, and so on. As your well-wishers with the strongest desire to make
                    our collaboration productive at every point, we have a perfect remedy strategized to tackle such
                    circumstances. We have created a revision policy framework for times when you are dissatisfied with our
                    services. Let us guide you to our policy conditions, which you should be aware of while approaching our
                    platform.

                <p class="pb-4">
                    Assignment Helper Deutsch is very flexible when it comes to offering comprehensive services to students.
                    However, there are some exceptions:
                </p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;" class="ml-7 mx-4">
                    <li class="my-2">
                        <p>
                            We will be committed to a fixed format, structure and word limit before starting the work. Any
                            changes to these ‘initial-stage’ details during the revision request will be considered as a new
                            work, making the same applicable to extra charges.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="my-2">
                        <p>
                            All the extra charges applied to your papers during the revision stage are strictly based on the
                            nature and volume of the work. To get an idea about the exact cost, you must contact our
                            customer care team for a detailed discussion.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="my-2">
                        <p>
                            Kindly note that we offer a maximum limit of 3 rounds of revision for editing works having a
                            large-scale volume. Since papers like research, dissertations, thesis, etc., demand an increased
                            word limit and groundwork, the respective revision work will equally require substantial effort.
                            This may or may not invite additional charges. Henceforth, for such cases, to avoid any
                            confusion between both parties, students must directly contact our customer care to clarify
                            their revision requirements.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="my-2">
                        <p>
                            Your revision demands will be thoroughly crosschecked before arriving at further decisions.
                            Kindly note that we won’t be responsible for the correctness or plagiarism of content added by
                            the student after the delivery of their work from our side.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The turnaround time of the revised paper depends on the depth of your demands. To make your
                            paper outstanding, our writers prefer to avoid rushed editing without proper background work.
                            Therefore, first, you must contact our customer care executives with your revision requests.
                            They will evaluate the same in terms of the volume of the edit and subject cruciality. Based on
                            the resulting conclusions, a suitable turnaround time will be notified to you.
                        </p>

                    <li class="my-2">
                        <p>
                            You should contact us for revision requirements within one week after the delivery of your
                            paper. This rule is employed to prevent confusion, unavailability of the appointed writer and
                            similar scenarios that can occur due to increased time intervals between our delivery and your
                            revision demands.
                        </p>

                    <li class="my-2">
                        <p>
                            Students can ask for a revision request after our 1-week thumb rule, only in the case of
                            unforeseen or extreme special cases. You can talk to our customer care to explain the same.
                            However, remember that the final decision regarding whether they should exempt you from charging
                            additional costs or not, solely rests on our team.

                            Your revised paper will be delivered on the agreed date, but a delay can happen during public
                            holidays and festival days. Thus, it is wise to coordinate the delivery dates accordingly after
                            discussing with our team.
